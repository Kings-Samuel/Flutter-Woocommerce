## Known bugs
*   Cart Screen
    -   not able to  delete last cart item. Alternative means is to reduce the quantity of the item to 0 and update cart. This is as a result of my limited knowledge of PHP which was used to develop the backend for the cart, as WooCommerce API does not have cart functionality of its own. If you can help with this, contact developer on Twitter @ https://twitter.com/apstkingssamuel

## Upcoming features
    *   Coupons
    *   Multiple addresses
    *   Live chat support
    *   Return order
    *   Update user details (first and last name)
